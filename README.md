# Leader-Follower-By-Phase
we present a new approach to identify the type of interaction by examining the phase of synchronization (i.e., in-phase, lagged, or anti-phase). To this end, w ewe have recently developed a toolbox the uses the WTC method to classify between the different types of interactions by using relative phase data from cross-wavelet transform analysis.

# Leader-Follower-By-Phase
we present a new approach to identify the type of interaction by examining the phase of synchronization (i.e., in-phase, lagged, or anti-phase). To this end, we have recently developed a toolbox the uses the WTC method to classify between the different types of interactions by using relative phase data from cross-wavelet transform analysis. 


Getting started with the LeaderFollowerbyphase script



1) Matlab version (2017 or above) is required

2) Matlab's Wavelet Transformation Toolbox (WTC) is required (https://alivelearn.net/?post_type=post&s=download).

3) Download leaderfollowerbyphase script from the Github or from this  link (https://www.ariel.ac.il/wp/sns/download/).

4) Launch Matlab and configure the WTC and leader follower script paths.

5) The script is self explanatory and ready to use.
